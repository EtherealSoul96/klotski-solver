# Klotski Solver  
My first project made back in 2017.  
It's a program that solves the puzzle game called Klotski.  
It was made in python with the limited knowledge I had at the time, so the code breaks every programming principle in existance.  
Many years later I recreated the program again from stratch but with a much better structure and I implemented graphics to it.
